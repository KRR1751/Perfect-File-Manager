# The Perfect File Manager!
> [!WARNING]
> Remember that this project is still in **Alpha!** And may contain bugs when using it as "default file viewer" right now, like for exp. by loading multiple files (like 5K+ *for exp. a WinSxS folder*), the program will froze and crash! I am already trying to solve this issue so stay up to date!

Do you hate the Windows' File Explorer, and you want something... Similar but different? Do you hate the File Explorer being UWP each new update?

Now this project is a whole new Win32 (or .net) open-source File Manager!

# How I install it?
> [!NOTE]
> This program didn't have any installer, so basically when you download it, you can extract the files what ever you want to and run it as well! :)
**But if you having issues for running the program:**
Try check if you have installed [.NET Framework 4.8](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0) or this program will **NOT WORK!**

## Setting it as a default
*not figured it out yet- But as I'll know how, I'll update this readme!*

*Any problem with it or with another question to say, please contact me on: minedowskrr@gmail.com email.*

# FAQ
**Why in Visual Basic?**
Because I did on it 6 years of experience (from year 2019) and I don't want to learn another programming language...

**Can I run it on older Windowses? (such as Windows XP etc.?)**
This shell runs on .NET Framework 4.8, so any Windows who support this, will also be able to run the shell.
